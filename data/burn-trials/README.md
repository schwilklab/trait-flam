The data in flamdt.csv was obtained in the fall of 2010 through the burning of litter samples collected in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California.

Samples of litter comprising 450 g were burned in a 15x150 cm aluminium trough. The apparatus build specifically for these burns was rigged with nine thermocouples laid in three different positions along the apparatus, at three different heights, recording temperature every second. Meter rulers were in place to determine maximum flame height. For a detailed methodology, please refer to the following publication:
