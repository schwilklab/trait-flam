## decomp-flam.R

## 1. read in decomp and flammability data
## 2. Creates a file, flamdecomp, that merges the flammability data with the 
##    decomposition data
## 3. Explores the relationship between spread rate and leaf length
## 4. Predicts spread rate from leaf length using the relationship uncovered in 3.
