## decomp-stats-reordered.R


## 0. Model decomposition to tease out the effect of alt, asp, on leaf length
##     change.
## 1. Model leaf length change for all species and all years to characterize 
##    that change and investigate significant differences among species and 
##    in between years. Do post-hoc test on contrasts.
## 2. Test on pines vs non-pines to confirm different behaviour
## 3. Model and do correlation analysis on mass loss rate, CN and leaf length change

## No longer included: Calculate effect size and overlap coefficient for each 
##                      of the species, between year 0 and year 1
##                     Do pairwise contrasts at the genus level
