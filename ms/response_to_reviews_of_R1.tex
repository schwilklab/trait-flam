\opening{Dear Dr. David Gibson,}

Enclosed is our revised manuscript research article, ``Moisture absorption and drying alter nonadditive litter flammability in a mixed conifer forest''.

The editors listed two substantial concerns with our revised manuscript: 1) we did not adequately articulate the novelty of the study and 2) that we had too strong an emphasis and ``\ldots and large amounts of text and graphics about single species results.'' We have tried to rectify both of these shortcomings with this submission.


We have combined figures as suggested.

I must admit I am a bit puzzled by the editor's complaint regarding ``single species'' results.  None of the figures show single species results. I raelize now that this complaint in the first round of reviews must have been referring to the plots that show results by genus.

[TODO]

{\bf Additional specific comments and our responses:}

Thank you. fixed

\begin{quote}
  Line 140 delete "on"
\end{quote}

We disagree as the sentence would no longer make sense. Can the editor state the objection?

\begin{quote}
Line 173:  what was the temperature of oven-drying? This is important to know.
\end{quote}

TODO. 50C. Lab hunmidity is very low (low single digists)

\begin{quote}
Line 344: typo in drier
\end{quote}

Oops! Yes, not the clothes dryer. Fixed!
