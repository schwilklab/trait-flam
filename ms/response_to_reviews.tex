\opening{Dear Dr. David Gibson,}

Enclosed is our revised manuscript research article, ``''.

We thank the editor and reviewer for their helpful comments and suggestions. We
have itemized each comment below and followed each with our reply and a list of
changes we made in response to the comment. 


{\bf Responses to Senior Editor's comments:}

\begin{quote}
 I support the AE's recommendation to reject but allow resubmission. However, the bar for a resubmission will be high. My feeling is that your study confirms the essential findings from your 2012 study published in Journal of Ecology with the addition that your methodology of drying down adds some realism. Indeed, the confirmatory nature of this study was pointed out by reviewer 2 in their point 6. In addition to the points raised by the AE and reviewers, I will be looking in any resubmission for more evidence that this study advances your earlier work (apart from your last paragraph, your discussion is largely an explanation of your results with little context from other studies), that the findings have real ecological relevance (i.e., does it matter to the mixed-conifer communities?) and how is the new dry down treatment related to dry down conditions in litter mixtures in the field. If you can adequately address all of these concerns then I'll be happy to consider a resubmission.
\end{quote}

TODO.

Add context also suggested by reviewer 1.

Thank you. Add context. Yes, several comments converged on the absolutely correct criticism that our discussion did not engage adequately with the literature.  Wer have added X and X...

The authors mention leaf size explicitly as an important parameter in non-additivity (with some references including their own 2012 paper) but they do not include it in the current study. Especially at low moisture, the small individual needles of Abies should cause low ventilation and a high likelihood of negative non-additivity on flammability, as was shown by Zhao et al 2016 Ecol. Evol. Figure 4). In the Methods, as observed also by reviewer 2, there is very little detail on the extent to which litter of the respective species was picked up as individual leaves, branchlets without leaves versus branchlets with leaves still attached. This is really important, also because positive versus negative non-additivity of leaf-twig mixtures have been reported recently (Zhao et al. 2019 Plant and Soil). I feel that data and/or photos indicating the size and shape of the different litter types (and if possible variability in these) are important to add and to be used in the interpretation of the results.
\end{quote}

We have added a figure showing particle size distributions for each of these species. Yes, Abies litter is a a combination of still attached needes and those that have detached from the branchlet.

\begin{quote}
In the Methods, it was unclear how the various treatments and replicates were grouped over time, given that temperature and humidity in the fire facility could vary. Were there blocks in time with one replicate for each of the treatments (in random burning order) within a block? Or was there a different statistical design in time? 
\end{quote}

Guided by the drying rates measured in the initail trials, we staggered saturation times across species aiming to allow completely blocked design in time. This staggering was mostly successful but Because some ignition attempts were unsuccessful, some days lacked the full complemnt of species while others later in the porcess sometimes had more than one replicate per species burned.

TODO

\begin{quote}
Line 196 (see also reviewer 2): how can we assume that the quality of the stored litter is the same as that used in the previous study 3 years earlier, i.e. can these two datasets be safely combined?
\end{quote}

We have added detail as requested by reviewer 2. See lines (X-X). The litter was dried in the lab (very low hmidity, but not oven dried), for several weeks on open racks. Then the litter was bagged and sealed and stored within garbage bags inside cardboard boxes in a lab storage area.  We saw no signs of mold or ongoing decomposition. We minimized handling of the bags to avoid mechanical damage and changes to little particle size.

Line 365 (see also reviewer 1): on the other hand Cornwell et al. 2015 New Phyt reported mostly high flammability in a range of Cupressaceae.
\end{quote}

TODO.  Mention.  Maybe due to very small samples that miminimize effects of packing in Cornwell et al 2015?



{\bf Responses to the Reviewer 1's comments}


\begin{quote}
This work compares mixtures of fuels, relative to their individual components, in terms of moisture retention and flammability. Moisture dynamics were also investigated in relation to properties of leaves of the species forming litter. This information is important in understanding flammability of surface fuels in the field. 

The study has been well thought through and well executed, and the ms is generally well written. Stylistically, the main problem is that commas are missing in many sentences. This might sound trivial, but will really help the reader.
\end{quote}

We thank the reviewer for their comments and apologize for the failure in proofreading. The reviewer should not have had to do such copy editing and I I sincerely apologize for that. We have taken heed of both reviewers' comments and fixed all specific grammar errors and fixed the issue we had with missing symbols. For brevity, we've omited response to the very simple suggested grammar fixes and simply made all requested changes. We respond to other points individually, below


\begin{quote}
line 72 - the comment about natural lightning ignitions comes from nowhere, and is a  bit of a jolt for the reader - rephrase slightly, e.g. many fires result from lightning ignitions, which are concurrent with ....
\end{quote}

TODO.

This portion was poorly written. We have rewritten this in response to reviewer 2's comment that most fires (or, at elast burned area) result from dry lightning strikes across the west. See our responses below.

TODO


\begin{quote}
line 103 - 'litter packing therefore affects fire behaviour in two ways' is easier to read
\end{quote}

Yes, agreed. We have tried to clean up the writing throughout and make the prose more active and precise.

\begin{quote}
line 133 - 'in mixtures of litter with varying levels..' is more explicit
\end{quote}

Agreed. fixed.

\begin{quote}
line 182 - affect, not effect
\end{quote}

Yes, an embarrassing error.


\begin{quote}
line 220 - see also Prior et al (2018)  Conceptualizing ecological flammability ....Fire 1, article 14
\end{quote}

Thank you. This was an oversight. We have also added more context from the
literature to our Discussion

TODO

\begin{quote}
lines 243/244 I was a bit puzzled here -It would help to be more specific here - which aspects of moisture dynamics? Which response variables did you use?  (or 'as described below')
\end{quote}

TODO. We have rewritten that section to be more precise.

\begin{quote}
line 290 - you show an association, not necessarily an effect
\end{quote}

True. We have edited this as suggested.

\begin{quote}
line 307 and line 326 - a minor inconsistency is that you analyse present species groups, yet discuss the results in terms of individual species
\end{quote}

TODO

Yes. We have made edits to

TODO. Check wording.



\begin{quote}
lines 348-349 - logically, this does not necessarily follow - factors such as large leaves or high SLA could independently affect both absorptive capacity and flammability - although fuel moisture does of course have a strong effect 
\end{quote}

TODO.


\begin{quote}
Table 4 - get rid of the unnecessary zeroes in the df column
\end{quote}

Fixed.

\begin{quote}
line 365 - wording is problematic - change to '...ignition is possible, it had faster spread rates ...'
\end{quote}

Agreed. Fixed.

\begin{quote}
line 365 - The low flammability of litter from your Cupressaceae species is interesting - Scarff and Westoby (2006) also found this for the Australian Cupressaceae genus Callitris, as did Bowman et al. (2018) J. Ecol 106, 1010 -1022
\end{quote}

We have added some better discussion of past results and included discussion of these papers, as well as contrasting with the Cornwell et al 2015 result as pointed out by the Associate Editor.

\begin{quote}
line 387 - capitalise 'I' in SI Table  8
\end{quote}

Fixed.

\begin{quote}
line 403 - change to 'to the completely dry litter mixtures studied in previous work'
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Figures 7 and 8 - is there a reason that you don't present the information in the same way as in Figure 6, if your main point is the discrepancy between the mixtures and the averaged individual values?
\end{quote}

We agree this does lack consistency and an early draft used the same concise Fig 6 format for all of them. But we decided that having time on the x-axis was worth the space and allows the reader more insight into the

Reviewer 2 pointed out some exceptions to the overall statistical pattern and those exceptions would not have been easily visible without an explicit time axis.


\begin{quote}
line 416 - Prior et al (2018) also show that rate of spread and consumability are largely independent in litter fuels
\end{quote}

TODO

Yes. We have added citations here.



{\bf Responses to the Reviewer 2's comments}

\begin{quote}

My major concerns are:
1. One motivation for the study is not valid. I do not completely agree with the authors that natural lightning ignitions are concurrent with precipitation and, therefore, fire behavior can depend on rate of drying following a wetting event. The efficiency of individual lighting strikes in igniting a fire is affected by the moisture properties of forest fuel at the moment of lighting (Krawchuket et al. 2006, Ecology). Dry lighting that occurs without any accompanied rainfall nearby is most likely to cause wildfire because the fuel is dry enough to be ignited.
\end{quote}

Yes, this sentence was poorly written and oversimplified. We thank the reviewer
for pointing this out and we have rewritten this section. However, our badly
made point was: lighting ignitions can occur during the same general period as
precipitation. As the reviewer points out, dry strikes that find dry fuel are
more likely to lead to fires (Abatzoglou et al 2016). That the total number
lightning strikes does not well predict burned area and that ignitions occur
often from dry strikes argues for the importance of fuel moisture. Although
synoptic weather conditions that create dry and wet storms differ, the
potential for precipitation and lightning during the same overall period of
thunderstorm activity often exists (eg wet and dry convection days can occur
under overlapping conditions, Rorig and Ferguson 1999).



--  we should have said that any any precipoation that occurs during seasons when lighting is likely can make ingitions less likely

2. The research question of the research is not explicitly stated both in the abstract and in the introduction. In the end of the introduction, the authors focus on specific data-collection goals, while leave the reader to figure out what the research question is.

\begin{quote}
3. The authors concluded that positive non-additivity appeared to be the rule in litter-driven fire and this non-additivity became more positive with fuel drying. But if we look closely at figure 8, non-additivity was negative within 50 hours since wetting, non-additivity was both positive and negative at about 75 hours since wetting, and non-additivity was positive at about 100 hours since wetting. The high variability of non-additive effects at about 75 hours since wetting might have important ecological effects on fire ignition and behavior, and are important information cannot be ignored.
\end{quote}


Yes, this is a good point and we have added some discussion of this.  We tried to lmit our statements, hwoever, to those supported by the statistical tests, and .....

\begin{quote}
4. The writing of this manuscript needs to be improved for clarity and accuracy. There are many typos in the text, and the using to scientific terms lack consistency through the text.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
5. The title does not precisely communicate the key message of the study. I suggest it is more precise to say “moisture effect … and alter non-additive flammability…”
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
6. The last paragraph of the discussion has a significant overlap with the last paragraph of the discussion in the authors’ previous paper (de Magalhães \& Schwilk 2012) in terms of the main content.

Line 50: add reference to the first sentence.
\end{quote}

TODO

We disagree in this case. 

\begin{quote}
Lines 50-61: in this paragraph, after the first sentence I think it is more logic to first explain the mechanism of moisture’s negative effects on fire, then explain the reason of the driving importance of dead fuel moisture content to surface fire ignition and behavior because fine dead fuels respond more readily to environmental changes than living fuels.
