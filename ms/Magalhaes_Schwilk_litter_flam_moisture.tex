  differing effects on flammability across the major litter types typified by
  different tree genera. Furthermore, we found that litter mixtures exhibited
  consistent positive non additivity in flame spread rate and that fuel
  consumption and flame spread rate both showed increasing positive non

\section{Introduction}

Fuel moisture content is an important, and often driving, determinant of surface fire behavior. Environmental conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind, drive the moisture content of the fuel available to burn \cite{Kreye+Varner+Etal-2018. In particular, fine dead fuels respond very readily to environmental changes \cite{Nelson 2001}.  Fuel moisture influences flammability and fire behavior through effects on ignition, spread rate, flame height, fuel consumption, and heat release, due to the high specific heat content of water \cite{Rothermel-1972}. Specifically, high moisture contents decrease the likelihood of ignition thereby reducing fire spread \cite{Nelson-2011}. Moisture acts as a heat-sink resulting in less energy available for propagation, and the resulting water vapor will both cool the flaming front and dilute flammable gases \cite{Albini-1976, Shafizadeh-1977}. Variation in moisture of living fuels has strong effects on flammability, but moisture of dead excised litter fuels can also vary. Moisture of litter fuels varies with climate, with seasons and with short term weather within a season. Therefore, the rate of drying and flammability at any particular moisture content are key parameters that influence the fuel flammability throughout the fire season \cite{Nelson 2001}.

Fire scientists have long categorized fuel by size classes that correspond to moisture exchange rates, although such simplified categories have long been recognized as not sufficient to describe species specific and decomposition effects on moisture dynamics \cite{Anderson-1985}. A variety of models describing moisture dynamics of fine fuels are used by fire scientists \cite[eg]{Viney-1991, Nelson-2000, Catchpole+Catchpole+etal-2001} that include at least temperature and relative humidity and most aim to describe equilibrium conditions although some include precipitation and solar radiation effects as well. Fuel moisture dynamics of leaf litter are dependent upon forest structure (shading and rain throughfall effects), litter physical structure, and chemical composition of the fuelbeds \cite{Nelson+Hiers-2008, Matthews-2014, Kreye_Hiers_etal-2018}. In many litter fuel driven systems, natural lightning ignitions are concurrent with precipitation and therefore fire behavior can depend on rate of drying following a wetting event. If species differ in the rate of drying, this may strongly influence relatively flammability across species at any particular time post-wetting. Such differential moisture content across time, may contribute to the often high spatial heterogeneity of surface fires.

In mixed-conifer forest of the western USA, where the fire regime is characterized by surface fires fuelled by plant litter, leaf traits can influence landscape scale fire behavior \cite{Schwilk+Caprio-2011}. Similarly, strong species specific effects on litter flammability are recorded for the forests tof the southeastern US \cite{Nowacki+Abrams-2008} where species-specific litter drying rates play a strong role in flammability feedbacks \cite{Kreye+Varner+etal-2013}.  Litter packing (measured as litterbed density or packing ratio) controls the flammability of dry litter fuels in seasonally dry climates (higher litter density reduces flammability) and leaf litter packing is influenced by leaf size and shape \cite{Fonda+Belanger+etal-1998, Kane+Varner+etal-2008, Schwilk+Caprio-2011, Kreye+Varner+etal-2013}. Fine fuel moisture content reduces ignition probability and flame spread rate \cite{Gisborne-1936, Fons-1946, Anderson+Rothermal-1965}. However, the mechanism by which both monospecific and mixed litterbeds absorb and desorb moisture is poorly known, and could be characterized by leaf traits, litter traits, or both.

Fuel moisture content through time is controlled by two main processes, absorptive capacity and rate of moisture loss \citep{Kreye-2013}. Absorptive capacity represents the potential maximum fuel moisture and is evaluated by the moisture content of litter when saturated. After saturation, the differences in moisture content indicate different abilities to retain moisture. The ability of litter to absorb and desorb water should be dependent on leaf and/or litter geometry, however, which traits control these processes are largely unknown. We propose two different sets of traits responsible for variation in the two processes mentioned: leaf particle geometry and litter bulk density. Litter characteristics such as surface-area-to-volume ratio, litter bulk density, mass density, particle size and shape, and chemical traits influence moisture diffusion through litter. Litter packing has two pathways of effect on fire behavior: directly by its effect on oxygen availability for combustion, and indirectly by its effect on dry-down rate, and both these pathways are affected by leaf litter traits (such as leaf size, litter bulk density). Fuelbeds composed of larger leaves with lower moisture retainability and decomposition rates favor drying, thus increasing the probability of ignition and fire spread rate.

Flammability is a multi-dimensional characteristic of fuels \citep{Schwilk-2015, Pausas+Keeley+etal-2017} with different traits influencing different components of fire behavior. In litter driven fire, the two major axes of variation are described by measurements related to flame spread rate and measurements related to heat transfer. Flame spread rate is easy to measure in burning trials, but heat transfer can be more difficult and often proxies such as duration of heating are used \citep{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012, Varner+Kane+etal-2015}. These different components of fire behavior have differing ecological effects. Species traits may interact such that the flammability of multi-species mixtures is not the average of the constituent species. Such non-additive effects have been shown to be synergistic in dry litter fuels where the flammability of a mixture is driven by the most flammable species  \cite{VanAltena+Logtestjin+etal-2012, Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012}. In most forests, leaf litter will be a mixture representative of the species in the stand. It is possible that similar non-additive effects may influence litter moisture content, especially if different leaf traits influence adsorptive capacity and drying rate. Blauw et al.\cite{Blauw+Wensink+etal-2015} suggests that moisture content can contribute to non-additive effects on heathland flammability, but the mechanism of this effect is not known.

We investigated species trait effects on litter moisture dynamics and consequent litter flammability across eight tree species in a temperate fire-prone forest in California. We determined the rate of moisture loss, the moisture of extinction (the threshold representing the moisture value above which fire will not ignite or spread) and the influence of moisture on the flammability of eight species from a mixed-conifer forest in California. Previous work described the flammability of these species in monoculture and in mixture for dry litter \cite{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012}. {TODO- more on oaks?]  Experimental burn trials of leaf litter at various moisture levels determined how time since wetting influenced two axes of flammability characterized by flame spread rate and total fuel consumed. The burn trials were also performed with multi-species litter mixtures to evaluate if species contribute equally to litter moisture dynamics or if there are non-additive effects. We compared leaf litter traits with the measured moisture absorption and desorption rates. Finally, we tested if the non-additive effects on  reported in previous studies occur under ecologically-relevant moisture levels and whether fuel moisture effects strengthen or mask such non-additivity.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Site description and species selection}

Field sites for this study were located in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California, USA (36 36N, 118 42 W) between 1600 and 2400 m elevation in mixed-conifer forest. I chose eight tree species that are representative of this type of forest: \emph{Pinus jeffreyi} Grev. \& Balf., \emph{Pinus lambertiana} Dougl., \emph{Pinus ponderosa} Dougl. ex Laws., \emph{Abies concolor} (Gord. \& Glend.) Lindl. ex Hildebr., \emph{Abies magnifica} A. Murr., \emph{Calocedrus decurrens} (Torr.) Florin, \emph{Quercus kelloggii} Newb., and \emph{Sequoiadendron giganteum} (Lindl.) J. Buchholz. In this study, I consider litter the top layer of leaves and small twigs less than 0.625 cm diameter (= 1-hour fuel) that have fallen in the previous year (mostly undecomposed). I collected the leaf litter in the summer (mid-June to mid-July) in 2011 and in 2012 from 21 separate sites across the study area. Effort was made to collect from different populations (minimum of four, each population separated from the others by 9 to 32 km) for each species to control for plastic and ecotypic effects. An exception to this involved the litter from A. magnifica which is restricted to the higher elevations and could only be collected from one area, due to logistical constraints. Within that area, \emph{A. magnifica} litter was collected from over 10 different individuals. For the remaining species, the collection involved 2-4 individual trees at each site, separated by at least 10 m. The litter was collect about 2 m away from the trunk to obtain a more uniform sample, because bark and heavier branches tend to fall closer to the tree trunk.

\subsection{Moisture absorption and desorption}


We produced dry-down curves to determine maximum water retainability and the rate of moisture content loss (dessication rate) for each species and for four distinct mixtures. These curves allowed us to  determine the rate at which a species loses moisture (approximated as
exponential decay), and determine maximum water content following saturation
and gravity draining. Samples from the eight species (six replicates per
species) and four mixtures (5 replicates per mixture type) were placed in
baskets (approximately 45 x 45 cm by 15 cm tall) constructed of 1 cm aluminum
screen. Samples were 450 g of litter (dry weight) per trial, and litter depth
was standardized to 10 cm by changing the horizontal dimensions of the basket.
Weight was measured by using a balance sensitive to 0.1 g (model XS16001L,
Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH). Samples were immersed in plastic storage bins
filled with water for 24 hours to fully saturate them. After saturation, the
baskets were removed from the water, allowed to drain for 3 minutes, and
samples weighed to measure maximum moisture content. The samples were then
allowed to dry in a partially controlled environment kept at 21 C temperature
and 30\% relative humidity, assessed via an iButton sensor (Maxim Integrated)
placed over the samples. During the dry-down process three subsamples were
taken at 24 hour intervals and weighed. These subsamples were then oven dried
for 24 hours at 100 C and re-weighed to assess moisture content. This was
repeated until the final sample from a basket was less than10\% moisture.


% The dry-down curves indicated that the eight species varied in their moisture behavior (Fig \ref{fig-drydown}). To determine a subset of species to use in the mixture trials, we performed analysis of contrasts using lsmeans package in R (TODO Lenth 2016) to guide choosing a subset of species for the litter mixtures. Based on the marginal means analysis, we chose four species to maximize variation in water retention and drying rate. Creating all possible three species mixtures from these four species resulted in four distinct three-species mixtures. 

% Leaf trait data

With only eight species in this study, our power to test leaf trait effects on the observed moisture dynamics is low, so we decided a priori to test the effect of one leaf trait likely to influence moisture absoorption, specific leaf area, and one litter trait known to directly effect flammability and likely to influence drying rate, litter bulk density. Specific leaf area was taken from leaf fresh leaf area and leaf dry mass from X individuals per species and was collected as part of an ealier study \cite{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012}.  Litter bulk density was obtained in this experiment for each basket by dividing the dry mass (450 g) by the estimated litter volume (basket width x length x litter depth).

\subsection{Flammability assessment}

We performed flammability tests across multiple moisture levels on monospecific
litter beds and on mixed litter beds with each species or mixture replicated 5
times at each moisture level. We used the initial dry-down experiment to guide
our timeing so as to attempt to burn samples over the full range of moisture
contents from 100\% to below 10\% moisture. To expand our data on the dry end
of this gradient, we supplemented these data with data from an earlier
experiment on well-dried litter \cite{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012}. This
supplemental data added five replicates per species at an oven dried moisture
content of $<$ 5\%. We assigned these replicates a time since wetting value of
144 hours equivalent to the longest time since drying for the wetted samples.
Flammability was assessed using a 150 cm long burn table, 15 cm wide and 15 cm
tall, in which leaf litter was placed and the table gently shaken to allow
settling. This design allows fire to reach constant flame spread rates
\cite{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012}. Two graduated metal rulers equally spaced along
the apparatus allowed visual determination of maximum flame height. Litter was
ignited with a propane torch; maximum adiabatic flame temperature of 1899 C,
http://www.benzomatic.com/products/fuel.aspx) at one end of the apparatus and
allowed to burn until extinction. If a species at a specific moisture level
failed to ignite after three attempts, no further attempts were made. A timer
was used to record time to ignition and duration of flaming combustion. The
flammability trials followed the methodology detailed in de Magalhães and
Schwilk \cite{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012}.

% and nine type-K thermocouples attached to data loggers measured temperature every second at three distances from the ignition point and at three different depths below the litter surface.
 
During flammability trials, we recorded time to ignition (s), duration of
flaming combustion (s), flame spread rate (mm/s), calculated by dividing the
length of the burned surface by the time it takes the flaming front to reach
the end of the apparatus, maximal flame height (mm), and mass loss (\%),
calculated as the difference between fuel mass before and after flame
extinction. Some trials resulted only in smoldering combustion; for those
trials, a time to ignition and mass loss were recorded, but flame spread rate
and flame height were recorded as zero. Our thermocouple system failed or data
was lost for two days of burning trials, therefore we have omitted those data
from this analysis. Our past work \cite{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012} demonstrated
that flame spread rate captures one important axis of flammability variation
\citep{Schwilk-2015, Pausas+Keeley+etal-2017} and percent fuel consumed
captures a portion of the second major axis of flammability variation (although
not as well as integrating temperature over time does). Our analysis,
therefore, focused on these two relatively orthogonal measures of flammability.

Burn trials occurred in a cement structure used to simulate house fires at the
Fire Department of the City of Lubbock. This structure minimizes wind and helps
regulate temperature and relative humidity. Temperature and relative humidity
were measured before every trial using a Kestrel 3000 (Nielsen-Kellerman,
Boothwyn, PA). To minimize temperature and relative humidity variation, all
trials were conducted on clear days between 10 am and 3 pm.


\subsection{Statistical analyses}

Dry-down curves were created based on the drying experiment, fitted with an exponential decay curve to each species.:

\begin{equation}
m = m_{max} e^{-\lambda t}
\end{equation}

Where $m$ is moisture content at time $t$, and $\lambda$ is the exponential
decay coefficient. To estimate these c oefficents we fit a linear mixed-effects
model by first taking the natural logarithm of moisture content, with time
since wetting and species as fixed effects nested within replicate basket. We
extracted the coefficients of the fitted model to describe maximum water
retainability ($m_{max}$; g of water per g of dry mass) and desiccation rate
($\lambda$) for each species. All analyses were conducted in R
\cite{RCoreTeam-2019}. We fit models with R packages `lme4'
\cite{Bates_Machler_etal-2015} and `afex' \cite{Singmann_Bolker_etal-2017}.
Approximate degrees of freedom and p-values were calculated by the
Kenward-Roger approximation \cite{Kenward_Roger-1997} which is recommended by
Luke \cite{Luke-2017} as producing acceptable Type 1 error rates.

We tested if one leaf trait (specific leaf area) and one litter trait (litter
bulk density) influenced moisture dynamics (maximum water retainability and
desiccation rate) by fitting linear models with species means as observations.
For each response variable we fit a single linear model with two predictors and
an interaction term.

Our past work \cite{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012} demonstrated that dry litter
flammability across these eight species was driven by leaf traits and litter
packing. Due to similar leaf traits, species within a genus tended to behave
similarly and the two scale-leaved genera in the Cupressaceae,
\emph{Calocedrus} and \emph{Sequoiadendron} also behaved similarly to one
another. Therefore, we used taxonomic groups (\emph{Abies}, Cupressaceae,
\emph{Quercus}, and \emph{Pinus}) as our flammability functional groups and
treated these as fixed effects in our models. The effect of fuel moisture and
time since wetting on flammability parameters were modeled using mixed effect
models with fuel moisture or time since wetting and taxon as fixed effects and
average vapor pressure deficit in the burning room during that trial as a
nuisance covariate.

We investigated possible non-additive effects on moisture and on flammability
by testing if moisture content and flammability of mixtures were predicted by
the average of the constituent species. To choose mixtures we first grouped the
species according to their maximum water retainability and dessication rate
according to estimated marginal means by species using the R package `emmeans'
\cite{Lenth-2019}. This resulted in four broad groups of species and we then
selected one representative species from each litter type group and produced
all four possible three-species litter mixtures using those four species. For
each mixture and time since wetting, we predicted moisture content based on the
mean content of the three consituent species at that time since wetting. We
predicted flammability parameters based on the models fit to single species
data described above and then calculated an expected moisture content and
spread rate as the average of these three values for the mixture. The
expectation from the null model was that the difference between observed and
predicted values of flammability will be zero. We tested if there were
significant departures from the null (zero) with a mixed effects linear model.
For flammability parameters, we fit linear mixed effect models with the
observed-predicted flammability value as the dependent variable and used Wald
tests to test if the centered intercept was different than zero (overall non
additivity) and if the slope with time since wetting was different from zero
(non additivity changing with drying).

\section{Results}

\subsection{Species specific moisture dynamics and leaf traits}

There are marked differences in the extent of moisture species retain initially
following wetting and draining by gravity (all p < 0.0001, Fig.
\ref{fig:drydown} and Table \ref{tab:drydown}). \emph{Q. kelloggii}, the only
broadleaf, is the species that retains the most moisture initially.
\emph{Quercus}, however, like the pines has a rapid dessication rate (Fig.
\ref{fig:drydown} and SI Fig. 1). Calculating estimated marginal means following the
linear mixed-effects model discriminated the species into three different
maximum water retention groups: 1) \emph{Q. kelloggii}; 2) \emph{P.
  lambertiana} and \emph{C. decurrens}; and 3) \emph{A. magnifica}, \emph{S.
  giganteum}, \emph{A. concolor}, \emph{P. jeffreyi} and \emph{P. ponderosa}
(SI Fig. 1). There are also differences in desiccation rates across the eight
species and estimated mixed linear model slopes discriminated species into
three groups from lowest to most rapid: 1) (\emph{C.decurrens}, 2) \emph{Abies
  spp} and \emph{S. gianteum}, and 3) \emph{Q. kelloggii} and \emph{Pinus spp}
(SI Fig. 2).

Across these eight species specific leaf area had a positive effect on maximum
water retention (Fig. \ref{fig:maxmc-di}, linear model p = 0.003) and litter
bulk density had a negative effect on desiccation rate (Fig. \ref{fig:bd-di},

\subsection{Moisture effects on flammability}


Flame spread rate declined with fuel moisture (Fig. \ref{fig:spread_moist}. \emph{Quercus} had higher spread rates across all fuel moistures and had a steeper decline in response to moisture than did the other groups (taxon by time since wetting interaction p = 0.022, Table \ref{tab:spreadrate_anova}). Fuel moisture negatively influenced fuel consumption and overall  fuel consumption as well as the rate of change with moisture content varied across the taxonomic group (Fig. \ref{fig:consume_moist}, Table \ref{tab:consume_moist_anova}). Although the overall ranking of groups was simlar for fuel consumption and for flame spread rate, in contrast to the pattern with spread rate, for fuel consumption, \emph{Pinus} and \emph{Abies} has a steeper decline in flammability with fuel moisture than did the other groups.

As a consequence of the relationships shown above, time since wetting had a strong effect on spread rate (p < 0.0001) and the slope of this effect varied by taxonomic group (Fig. \ref{fig:spread_time}, Table \ref{tab:spreadrate_anova}). The pines were able to ignite and burn much sooner after wetting than the other genera, none of which had measurable spread rates until burning was attempted 72 hours after wetting (note that trials that failed to even ignite smoldering combustion are ommitted completely from the model and figure). At that point, the \emph{Abies}, \emph{Calocedrus}, and \emph{Sequiadendron} had dryer litter than did the \emph{Quercus}, yet the spread rates were slow. \emph{Quercus} had the steepest response to time since wetting (Fig. \ref{fig:spread_time}, SI Table 4)).

Fuel consumption was highly variable across trials and intermediate values were less common than very low are moderately high consumption (Fig. \ref{fig:spread_time}). All parameters significantly contributed to the model as indicated by Table \ref{tab:consume_time_anova}. As with flame spread rate some pines had the most rapid response to drying. However, unlike in the other flammability analyses, here the pines did not all behave similarly: \emph{P. lambertiana} had lower fuel consumption than did \emph{P. ponderosa} and \emph{P. jeffreyii}. We noticed this during trials and in model fitting we found that placing \emph{P. lambertiana} in its own group allowed model convergence that was otherwise impossible.

\subsection{Non additivity in  litter mixtures}

Based on visual inspection of the dry down curves and the estimated marginal means for maximum water retainability and desiccation rate (SI Figs 2-3), we selected four species to represent the full range of litter moisture dynamics for use in the litter mixtures and examined all four three-species combinations of those four. The four species were \emph{Abies concolor}, \emph{Calocedrus decurrens}, \emph{Pinus jeffreyi} and \emph{Quercus kellogii}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{figs_tables/fig8_mixture_drydown-curves.pdf}
\caption{Fuel moisture by time since saturation for four litter mixtures.  Codes for species in mixtures: Ab = \emph{Abies concolor}, Ca = \emph{Calocedrus decurrens}, Pi = \emph{Pinus jeffreyi} and Qu = \emph{Quercus kellogii}. Moistures were measured every 24 hours but data are shown with slight horizontal jitter to reduce point overlap.}
  \label{fig:mixture_dry_down}
\end{figure}

Mixture dry down rates and maximum water retention showed some relationship to the dry down curves for individual constituent species (Fig. \ref{fig:mixture_dry_down}. For example, the mixture that does not contain \emph{Q. kelloggii} (AbCaPi in Fig. Fig. \ref{fig:mixture_dry_down}) has the lowest initial retention. Although intiial water retention differed across mixtures (RESULTS?), there was no significant difference in dry down rates (slopes in linear model based on log of moisture content).

% . The moisture content of a mixture at any given time was also dependent upon the bulk density of the mixture (anova analysis resulted in a better model if bulk density was included as a fixed effect, p=0.01135).

  \label{fig:mixture_obs_pred_mc}
\end{figure}

There was some evidence for non additive in drying rate a tendency for litter mixtures. Mixtures tended to have lower water content than predicted from the mean of the constituent species after wetting, but higher water content than expected after long drying (Wald test shows slope of mixed linear model illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:mixture_obs_pred_mc} less than 1, p < 0.0001).

  \label{fig:mixture_obs_pred_consume}
\end{figure}

Flammability measures also demonstrated nonadditivity in mixtures.  Flame spread rate was consistently slightly higher than predicted (Fig \ref{fig:mixture_obs_pred_spread}, Wald test of mixed linear model centered intercept for observed-predicted values greater than zero, p = 0.017) and the positive non additivity increased with time since wetting (slope greater than zero, p = 0.005). Fuel consumption, however, showed no overall bias towards positive or negative non additivity, but did show a positive relationship with time since wetting (Fig. \ref{fig:mixture_obs_pred_consume}, p < 0.0001).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Species specific moisture dynamics and leaf traits}

The species in this study displayed different patterns of both moisture absorption and desorption, which were controlled by different litter traits (specific leaf area and litter bulk density, respectively). \emph{Q. kelloggii} was the species that absorbed the most moisture, followed distantly by the finest-needled pine, \emph{P. lambertiana}. These species that have a greater absorptive capacity are also among the most flammable in terms of spread rate when dry. One presumption of ours prior to this experiment was that the high flammability previously reported for \emph{Q. kelloggii} \cite{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012} would disappear under higher fuel moisture contents. This was partly supported: \emph{Q. kelloggii} fails to ignite until after 72 hours of drying in this study (Figs. \ref{fig:spread_time} and \ref{fig:consume_time}). However, high moisture content in this oak was unable to suppress ignition of mixtures to which it contributed (Figs. \ref{{fig:mixture_obs_pred_spread} and \ref{{fig:mixture_obs_pred_consume}). 
NOTE: P lambertiana higher water absorption, presumably due to higher SLA.

With eight species, power to detect species-specific trait effects on these moisture patterns was weak, but we examined one litter trait known to directly influence flammability: litter bulk density. Litter density is largely driven by leaf size in this system \cite{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012}.  The overall dry-down process of litter is being controlled by both traits intrinsic to the leaf particles (leaf geometry) and traits intrinsic to the litter bed (bulk density). Decomposition can also affect moisture content in litter. Van Wagner (1969), investigating fuel weathering, found that pine needles had a variation in moisture content 3 to 6 times greater when they lacked their protective wax coating when compared to intact needles.


T\subsection{Time since wetting and flammability}

After a rain event, the litter of different species will exhibit different moisture contents. These results show that both time to ignition and spread rate were affected by time since wetting, and the interaction of time since wetting and genus was also significant.

This indicates that there is a species-specific response to flammability based on time since wetting, and the differences are due to different moisture contents at each time interval. Therefore, mere moisture content will not inform on the fire behavior measures of a litter bed. Species composition of the litter must be considered, and time since the last rain event should allow the determination of the potential flammability of an area. 

Time since wetting, as expected, lowered the flammability of the eight species in this study and its effect overwhelms the effect of volatile content. The pines are more flammable at higher moisture contents when compared to volatile-rich species such as \emph{C. decurrens}, \emph{Abies spp}. or \emph{S. giganteum}. This effect is influenced by litter bulk density and is likely to persist in fuel mixtures where the constituent species have different desiccation indices and therefore will have different moisture contents.


% I have determined moisture of extinction for the eight species in this study. As expected, species that have higher flammability values (Pinus spp.) had higher moisture of extinction than species with lower flammability (Abies spp. and S. giganteum). I used a higher cut-off moisture for the burn trials than the moisture of extinction found in the literature (65\% vs. 27-30\%; \citep{ Rothermel-1972} [TODO Dickinson et al. 2016] in order to be conservative, as moisture content studies as sparse. However, Q. kelloggii was still flammable at ~80-90\% moisture content (values at 72 hours used for the species mixtures), which I did not anticipate. Due to its high moisture content, Q. kelloggii was not burnt at 24 and 48 hours since wetting, which explains the gap shown in the Figures. Though I cannot comment on the exact behavior of Q. kelloggii at 24 and 48 hours, it is unlikely to be more flammable than the pines. This result indicates that though Q. kelloggii might be too wet to start a fire right after a rain event, Q. kelloggii litter dries faster than the other species in this study and will become very flammable within two days.

\subsection{Effects of moisture and flammability in litter mixtures}

We tested the dry-down process and flammability of four unique three-species litter mixtures. These mixtures contained species representative of all dry-down behavior types observed in single species trials, as assessed by the Tukey test. As expected from the single species results, mixtures that contained Q. kelloggii absorbed more water during the saturation period, but there was no difference in desiccation rate among the mixtures. However, when investigating the non-additivity in moisture content, the mixture that did not contain Q. kelloggii retained more moisture than would be predicted by the null model (arithmetic average of the three constituent species in the mixture). In general, non-additivity varied with moisture content, with positive non-additive behavior at lower moisture contents (<75\%, 72-96 hours since wetting occurred) and negative non-additive behavior at very high moisture contents (>200\%, 0 hours since wetting occurred). This result indicates that immediately after a rain event, the moisture content of a mixture will be lower than expected, however these high values for moisture content are unlikely to be found in natural litters. As the mixture dries, the dry-down behavior will approximate the null model, and three to four days after the rain event the dry-down behavior will become non-additive again. The positive non-additivity seems influenced by litter bed characteristics, since the strongest non-additivity was observed for the mixture with two species that have less dense litter: Q. kelloggii and P. jeffreyi (CaPiQu).


The fact that mixtures tended to have lower water content than predicted from
the mean of the constituent species after wetting, but higher water content
than expected after long drying is a bit surprising as past work has shown that
mixtures tend to be more aerated than expected given the bulk density of litter
of individual species \citep{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012}. This non additivity in
drying rate did not fully explain non additivity in flammability, however.


The flammability results for the mixtures followed closely the results obtained for the individual species. Mixtures containing Q. kelloggii and P. jeffreyi had faster spread rates and lower times to ignition, resulting in higher overall flammability. These results are influenced by the lower bulk densities of litter mixtures containing those two species. There was a non-additive effect of moisture on flammability for the four mixtures in this study, reinforcing results shown for dry litter \citep{Magalhaes+Schwilk-2012, VanAltena+Logtestjin+etal-2012}. Spread rate and time to ignition had significant non-additivity, and were strongly influenced by the species present in the mixture. Presence of C. decurrens in a mixture marked a big difference between the null model and the prediction. This was due to several failed ignitions for this species when burned individually, which conditioned the predicted values, while all the mixtures ignited. There were marked differences in the non-additivity results from this study and the results from a previous study investigating dry litter samples. The presence of non-additive effects in moisture content leads to non-additive effects in the flammability of moist litter beds. When accounting for this effect, the non-additivity on the flammability of moist litter beds is subtler, when compared to species effects. This result, together with previously published work, suggests that litter flammability is prone to non-additive effects, reinforcing the idea that we cannot approach flammability by lumping species into fuel categories, as is common in fire behavior models. Community flammability is dependent on and particular to its constituent species and cannot be addressed by simply averaging the flammability of all species it comprises. This dynamic view is likely to be increasingly relevant considering ongoing climate change, which predicts changes in community assembly.

% I have found non-additive effects (both positive and negative) in moisture content and in the flammability of wet litter mixtures of mixed-conifer forest. These results complement the efforts of Blauw et al. (2015) for moist litter and add to the literature investigating non-additivity in litter flammability (de Magalhães and Schwilk 2012, van Altena et al. 2012). However, these studies are limited in the scope of the species studied and suggest that non-additivity needs to be investigated at a larger scale, within different systems and comparatively across a larger number of species. Moisture content is considered the single most important driver of litter flammability and the results from my study indicate how leaf and litter traits affect moisture dynamics, and how moisture effects on litter flammability are species-specific. A trait-based perspective provides a better mechanistic understanding of moisture dynamics of litter fuel flammability and fire behavior and is especially important for predicting and understanding fire in plant communities that are changing.
